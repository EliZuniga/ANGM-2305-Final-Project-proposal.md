# Description
This program will open an interactive version of Connect Four that allows the user to play against another user. I believe it would be a fun and a engaging project to take on in developing a accessible, and visually appealing Connect Four game experience. 

# **Features** 
* **Feature** 1: The user will be able to use the mouse to decide where the connect four chips will land on, doing this I hope to make the user feel that their decisions matter.
* **Feature** 2: Two players will be able to play the Connect four game.
* **Feature** 3: A "Player One Wins!" will appear for the user who gets the first connect four. Having this I believe will make the users stay engaged with the game until they see themselves win.
* **Feature** 4: If both users do not get a connect four the game will direct a draw

# **Challenges**
* Learn more about the interactive features of the Pygame library, for example mouse input.
* Make sure that the game can call a draw on its own when both the players get to a point where the game is not winnable.
* Add color to the connect our color chips.

# **Outcomes**
### Ideal Outcome: 
The program to run a full game with the basic idea of a Connect Four game. If a player wins to have a text pop up to represent the winner, it should also be able to call a draw when the game can’t have a winner.

### Minimal Outcome:
The minimum outcome would be the program allowing a full playable game that after a game is won or drawn the user would have to exit out and run the program to play the game again. This would unfortunately mean that the game cannot tell who won or even if the game is playable after a certain point, the game would be playable but would be missing mechanics.

# **Milestones**
* ### Week 1
  - Start developing the main function that will be needed for the four connect game to run at its full potential.
* ### Week 2
  - Implement the draw system for the game. 
  - Have the vertically suspended grid implemented. 
  - Mouse input works as indented.
* ### Week 3
  - Finalize the program. 
  - Optimize the program to have good performance for the best user experience. 
  - Turn in the Final.
