# Description
This project is a digital version of the classic board game "Connect Four," a favorite of mine since childhood. I chose this project because I wanted to create something both fun and engaging, and I thought Connect Four would be the perfect fit. My objective was to build a visually appealing game with clear and understandable logic.

The game is built using Python and the Pygame library. I structured the code with a main function and three helper functions to manage different aspects of the game. I focused on simplicity and clarity in the game mechanics, while learning how to handle player input via mouse clicks and draw game elements using Pygame. This project helped me deepen my understanding of Python functions, loops, and basic event handling in graphical applications.

While the game currently only supports two-player mode, I originally planned to implement a single-player mode against a computer opponent. Due to time constraints from other projects, I was unable to complete this feature. I also hoped to add audio effects to enhance immersion but wasn’t able to include them in the final version.

One area I’d like to improve in the future is the user interface—adding animations and refining the overall visual design to make the game more polished. Despite the features I didn’t get to implement, I’m happy with how the project turned out and proud that the core gameplay works as intended. It was a valuable and enjoyable learning experience.
