# Connect Four

# Description
This program will open an interactive version of Connect Four that allows the user to play against another user. I believe it would be a fun and a engaging project to take on in developing a accessible, and visually appealing Connect Four game experience. 

# Features 
* **Feature** 1: The user will be able to use the mouse to decide where the connect four chips will land on, doing this I hope to make the user feel that their decisions matter.
* **Feature** 2: Two players will be able to play the Connect four game.
* **Feature** 3: A "Player One Wins!" will appear for the user who gets the first connect four. Having this I believe will make the users stay engaged with the game until they see themselves win.
* **Feature** 4: If both users do not get a connect four the game will direct a draw

# Challenges
* Learn more about the interactive features of the Pygame library, for example mouse input.
* Make sure that the game can call a draw on its own when both the players get to a point where the game is not winnable.
* Add color to the connect our color chips.

# Outcomes
